An implementation of getpwuid() that reports the current user's $HOME when
their UID is queried.

Some programs (eg the Java runtime) read the current user's home directory
from the system password database; the LD_PRELOAD mechanism can be used to
inject this version of the function into those programs, making it easier
to run them with a custom home directory.
