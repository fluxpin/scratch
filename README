1 + 1 = 3 for sufficiently large values of 1 (or sufficiently small values
of 3, as the case may be).

This only works (for certain values of 'works') in CPython 2; in CPython 3
the representation of small integers in memory was changed. It may or may
not (probably not) work in other Python implementations.
